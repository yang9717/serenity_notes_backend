A MERN stack mental health practice management system designed to streamline client documentation, staff management, and progress tracking.\
\
It also provides an intuitive interface for managing client notes, tracking progress, and collaborating with team members.

## üí° Project Inspiration
- This project was inspired by by the real-world challenges faced at the mental health clinic where my aunt works.
- The clinic relied on scattered Excel files for tracking sessions across different therapists, requiring manual daily reports: an inefficient and error-prone process.
- After rounds of discussions with the owner and staff (including restructuring the processes), I developd it to centralize session documentation and streamline reporting, which allows staff to spend less time on documentation and more time focusing on what truly matters: patient care.
